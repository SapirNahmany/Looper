## General Info

This website simulates a loop machine with 9 pads that represent different loop samples. The machine enables
playing these loop samples in real-time and plays it back on repeat.

When a pad is turned on, the sample which he represent will start playing its loop on the
next loop cycle and will be repeated as long as the pad is on.

Clicking the first pad will starts its loop immediately.
